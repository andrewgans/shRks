#Question:

Does change in surface water temperature affect shark migration patterns?

```{r}
tigershark <- read.csv("Regularized_tiger_shark_tracks.csv")
view(tigershark) #years range: 2010-2019
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
